## About Me

## About Me

- Name: **Leon Seferi**
- Role: CS BSc student — aspiring software engineer
- Location: London 🇬🇧
- Bio: "CS BSc student | learning, building, iterating." 

I’m passionate about backend development and building experimental simulators and utilities. I enjoy turning ideas into working prototypes, iterating quickly, and applying practical CS concepts learned at university to real codebases. Currently building and maintaining Python-based projects and improving my full-stack and DevOps skills.

Currently learning: backend engineering patterns, API design, containerization, and simulation tooling.
